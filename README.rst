rst-icalendar-event-tracker (riet)
==================================

Python3 script that finds calendar events in easily readable/editable `ReST
(.rst) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_ files with free-form
structure, checks any associated feeds or conditions, and creates iCalendar
entries from these.

Simple example for one-off event spec anywhere in source rst file::

  - Make this rst-calendar parser thing

    :ts: 2018-07-20
    :url: https://github.com/mk-fg/rst-icalendar-event-tracker

    Push the script to local repo and its github mirror to track it there.

Any separate block with ``:ts:`` field in it (``:name: description`` is an rst
"field list" syntax) will be parsed as an event, with title picked-up either
from ``:title:``, section title or first line/paragraph (as in this example).

Time spec itself can be anything that "date -d" will accept on the command-line,
with special handling for "every X" specs, which will add recurring event.

| See `cal.rst <cal.rst>`_ for more precise syntax info and an extended example.
| See also - `rst quickref doc <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`_.

Intended use is creating persistent on-screen notifications from iCalendar
entries generated by this script in e.g. `conky <http://conky.sourceforge.net/>`_
window or similar gadget on the main desktop screen to avoid forgetting things,
yet not require editing raw iCalendar files, org-mode (special emacs-only markup
for such stuff) or using anything but an arbitrary dumb text editor for these.
